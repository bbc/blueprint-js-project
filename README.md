# Blueprint JS project

This project aims to be a starting point for any new JS project in Archive Search with a minimum set of configuration and tools that are the useful in any JS service and considered best practices from the community.
It will encourage consistency in our codebase of different services, optimise the Developer Experience (DX) and of course make easier the onboarding of new devs.
